## Technologies Used:
##### Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS

## Getting Started: 
#### https://jfar41.github.io/Project-1/

#### I briefly explain to myself with comments as to why I added certain code in parts that I originally struggled with to encourage learning for those who might be confused at first glance.

## Next Steps:
* Instead of having players refresh the page so that they can play a new game I can create a button that can be clicked to reset the board
* Make the website more aesthetic
* Create an option to play against an AI or play against a friend (which is what the current version does)
* Fix positioning of board and text on smaller screens for when people play on their smartphones
